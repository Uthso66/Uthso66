# Md. Tarikul Islam Uthso 🚀

🧠 **Hybrid Software Engineer**  
🎨 Motion-first frontend • ⚙️ Systems thinking • 🤖 Applied AI • 🛡️ Reliability-driven

I build **interactive systems**, not static pages.  
UI is treated as a **state machine**, animations are **deterministic**,  
and data is allowed to have **physical presence** 🌌

🧪 Background in **Samsung R&D (QA)** → edge-case discipline & reliability  
🧩 Competitive programming → structured thinking under constraints  
⚡ Currently shipping **Next.js + 3D + AI-powered products**, end-to-end

## 🧩 What I Work On

🎬 **Motion-Driven Frontend Systems**  
Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, GSAP, React Three Fiber, Three.js  
→ animation lifecycle hygiene, scroll-based systems, interactive 3D UI

🤖 **End-to-End AI Integration**  
PyTorch, FastAPI, ML inference pipelines  
→ not just APIs — real models, reproducible setups

🧠 **Systems & Problem Solving**  
Algorithms, constraints, performance-aware thinking  
→ competitive programming as mental training, not resume padding
