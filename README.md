# Md. Tarikul Islam Uthso

**Hybrid Software Engineer**  
Motion-first frontend • Systems thinking • Applied AI • Reliability-driven

I build **interactive systems**, not static pages.  
UI is treated as a **state machine**, animations are **deterministic**,  
and data is allowed to have **physical presence**.

Background in **Samsung R&D (QA)** → reliability and edge-case discipline.  
Competitive programming → structured thinking under constraints.  
Currently shipping **Next.js + 3D + AI-powered products**, end-to-end.

## What I Work On

- **Motion-driven Frontend Systems**  
  Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, GSAP, React Three Fiber, Three.js  
  → animation lifecycle hygiene, scroll-based systems, interactive 3D UI

- **End-to-End AI Integration**  
  PyTorch, FastAPI, model inference pipelines  
  → not just APIs — real models, reproducible setups

- **Systems & Problem Solving**  
  Codeforces, Codewars, LeetCode  
  → algorithms, constraints, and performance-aware thinking

## Flagship Projects

🔹 **Cosmic Coffee Tracker**  
_A data-driven 3D UI where persistence has physical consequences_  
Next.js • Supabase • React Three Fiber • GSAP  
→ Each database row manifests as a star in a galaxy.  
→ Deletion triggers synchronized visual destruction + state cleanup.

🔹 **Mojito Cocktail Landing Page**  
_Motion engineering & scroll-based interaction architecture_  
React • TypeScript • GSAP  
→ Animation timing, scroll orchestration, lifecycle-safe cleanup.

🔹 **AI Image Captioner**  
_End-to-end inference system using BLIP_  
Next.js • FastAPI • PyTorch  
→ Decoupled frontend + backend with reproducible ML inference.

🔹 **CIFAR-10 Classifier**  
_Transfer learning with ResNet18_  
PyTorch  
→ Clean training pipeline, evaluation, and reproducibility.
